            My Mom grew up in New York for her entire life. She has a younger brother and two older half siblings. She swam in high school and during her time as a student at CCNY where she met Julian Abreu, my dad. They eventually got married and
            later had me and my siblings. She worked in marketing at an architecture firm until she stopped due to medical reasons and became a stay at home mom. I have seen her in pain, in true happiness, in the funniest moods, and I can't help but
            look up to her. My mom is my hero.
